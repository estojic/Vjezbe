									<h2>About her</h2>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> 
									Helena Klakočar Vukšić, born in 1958, spent her childhood years in the multi-cultural harmony of the Bosnian town of Tuzla. She spent her teenage years in Maribor, and later attended the Academies of Fine Arts in Zagreb and Tilburg.
									<br>Helena Klakočar is a versatile artist (painter, maker of animated films, comics and illustrations) who is very good at graphic storytelling. In the late 70s, she began publishing her illustrations in Zagreb's Tina and Maribor's Katedra magazines. In the early 80s, she published her first comic in Zagreb's Polet and Heroina, and in the Belgrade magazine Vidici. In 1988, Mladina magazine published her series of comics entitled Take Your Time. 
									<br>As the founding member of the Zagreb artistic group ZZOT, which united comic, film and graphic artists, she has executed many posters, illustrations and murals since the early 80's. She has also made three animated films, which complement her artistic opus. In 1990, Helena Klakočar manged the ESCE art gallery with a group of Croatian alternative artists. 
									<br>Her first comic book, "Passage en douce", published by Freon in Brussels in cooperation with L' Atelier d' édition, won her the Alph Art, a prize for the best French translated album by a foreign artist, at this year's comic festival in the French city of Angoulême. The story in the book is in fact from a collection of Helena's diary notes. The diary notes were made at the end of 1991, during her familiy's voyage on the Mediterranean Sea from which they could not return home because a war broke out in the former Yugoslavia. An otherwise autobiographical story is amplified with the theme of exile, and that of one's relationship to art, money and politics.

						<h3>The moral: In war, the one who attacks does not know shame.</h3>
						<blockquote>
						During my studying at the Academy I was working on comics because of these three reasons : pleasure, financial satisfaction and local fame. It was pleasant to achieve all this by having fun myself and others with stories about a woman-radio, the beer that speaks or crystals that enter human bodies. Since I deal with documentary comics, I have noticed that things have a new dimension, an unexpected "addition". If I find myself in a situation when someone is late with his payment, when he is cynical or just unpleasant... I take out my book, decorated by a red ribbon (of the Alph-Art award) and explain what I am in for. When the person realizes that "I - write - about - and - draw - EVERYTHING - that - happens - to - me - in - my - diary - and - that - it - is - PRINTED - and - OTHERS - can - read - it", the power balance changes. I become the master of the situation. I can imagine only one case when that recipe is not effective: the WAR.

						<h2>Restless sea - Nemirno more</h2>
						<p>In summer 1991 she went on a sailing holiday with her husband and two-year-old daughter. Their return from Greece was prolonged because of the outburst of the war in Former Yugoslavia. On a small catamaran during the winter she was capturing daily life and memories of her homeland in drawings and text, depicted in her award-winning graphic novel "Restless Sea 1" (in French "Passage en douce") which is translated into several languages.</p>
